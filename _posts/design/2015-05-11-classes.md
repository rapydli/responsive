## Big Data Deployments in Indiana University Classes

Indiana University has incorporated several new courses related to BIg
Data analysis. As prt of this they are using the Cloudmesh framework
(http://mycloudmesh.org/learning) to develop easy to use deployment
scripts. We will be reusing this technology to incorporate deployments
for Deep learning modules.

Through the leveraging of cloudmesh modules it will also be possible
to provide deployments in clouds through virtual cluster generation
and hadoop clusters.
